# i3config
Config file for my new sweet i3 setup. Default terminal is 'terminator' with transparency using 'compton'.
Dependencies:
  - compton
  - fira code (font)
  - terminator (terminal)

  A wallpaper is set with nitrogen on startup (in a profile file)
The OS I'm currently using is Ubuntu 20, have used Arch before
but Ubuntu just has better support for drivers out of the box.
  Also tried pure Debian first but was really anoying getting
the right image from the webside with non-free drivers.
  And also you can argue for pacman all you want but apt is good
stuff.

  If anyone against all odds would like to try this config, remember
the font size is due to my 2k screen, this might be too large
or too small for you depending on your screen resolution.

  By the way Fira Code I love you <3
  Best font evar
